Dear {{ display_name }},

the WordPress eID-Login Plugin prepared a Certificate Rollover. New certificates
have been created and added to the SAML Metadata ({{ metadata_url }}).

The currently used certificates are about to expire and remain valid until
{{ valid_to }}. The new certificates will be activated on {{ activate_on }}.

Please check, if you need to add the new certificates manually at the used
Identity Provider!

If you want to trigger the rollover manually at some earlier time, you can do
this in the Settings page of the eID-Login Plugin.
